# FolderSize, written in C

A small single-file project, aimed at reaching the lowest possible folder size evaluation time possible.

Whilst the **FolderSizeCPP** repo is a derivation of a bigger project, where the code was utilized, a non-C++ variant is useless to me, however I still wanted to see how fast we can get by using even faster language than C++. Turns out `not much`

## Usage

To get the size of your desired folder, simply use `FolderSize [Path]`
